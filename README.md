# Energy Consumption Prediction using Shiny & R

Welcome to my CoolCurrents Shiny app repository! This project was developed as part of the final submission for IST 687 - Introduction to Data Science. The app is designed to analyze and predict energy consumption patterns during the peak month of July, with a focus on promoting sustainable energy practices in South Carolina and North Carolina.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The goal of CoolCurrents is to provide advanced energy analytics that empower users to manage their energy consumption proactively. This Shiny app serves as a key tool, offering predictive insights into energy usage, particularly in response to rising temperatures during summer.

### Features
- **Data Integration**: I integrated multiple datasets, including static house data, energy consumption data, and weather data, to provide a comprehensive view of energy usage.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I conducted detailed visualizations and descriptive statistics to help users understand energy consumption patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: I utilized advanced predictive models like Linear Regression, SVM, and XGBoost to forecast hourly energy usage throughout July.
- **Scenario Simulation**: A simulation feature predicts peak energy demand based on a hypothetical 5-degree Celsius increase in July temperatures.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The Shiny app includes interactive maps, time-series visualizations, and energy consumption breakdowns.

## How to Use the Shiny App

### Navigation
The app is divided into several sections:
1. **Current vs. Future Energy**: Compare current and projected energy consumption across different counties and times of the day.
2. **Total Consumption Chart**: View total energy consumption for the current year compared to the next year, with percentage increases highlighted.
3. **Energy Categories Dashboard**: Explore a detailed breakdown of energy consumption by categories such as kitchen, heating, and cooling.
4. **Aggregated Energy Demand**: Analyze energy demand aggregated by weather file cities, with an interactive slider to focus on specific timeframes.
5. **Leaflet Maps**: Visualize current and future energy consumption on an interactive map, with color-coded markers indicating peak usage times.

### Insights and Recommendations
The app provides actionable insights into reducing peak energy demand, focusing on strategies like optimizing HVAC cooling efficiency and adjusting cooling setpoints.

## My Contributions
- **Data Cleaning**: I was responsible for cleaning and preprocessing the datasets to ensure the quality and consistency required for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I conducted thorough EDA to uncover key patterns and trends in energy consumption.
- **Data Analysis and Modeling**: I implemented and evaluated various predictive models, including Linear Regression, SVM, and XGBoost, to forecast energy usage.
- **Shiny App Development**: I contributed to the development of interactive visualizations and maps within the Shiny application, enhancing user experience.

## Conclusion
The CoolCurrents Shiny app is a powerful tool designed to help users understand and manage energy consumption during peak demand periods. By integrating various data sources and employing advanced modeling techniques, the app provides valuable insights to support sustainable energy practices.

Feel free to explore the app, and if you have any questions or feedback, I'd love to hear from you!
